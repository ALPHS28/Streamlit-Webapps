# Streamlit Web Apps

Welcome to the Streamlit Web Apps repository! Here, you will find simple but effective web applications built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal code. One of the applications included in this repository is a countdown timer.



## Introduction
Streamlit is an excellent choice for rapidly creating web applications, dashboards, and interactive data visualizations. This repository contains web apps created with Streamlit to help you get started on your own projects. The first application is a countdown timer that you can use for various timing purposes.

## Countdown Timer
The "Countdown Timer" application allows you to set a timer for a specific amount of time in minutes. Once the timer is started, it counts down and displays the remaining time in a user-friendly format. When the timer reaches zero, it notifies you that the time is up.

### How to Run the Apps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Streamlit if you haven't already. You can do this with the following command: `pip install streamlit`.
3. Navigate to the repository's directory.
4. Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command: `streamlit run <filename>.py` where `<filename>` is the name of the Streamlit app you want to run (e.g., `streamlit run countdown_timer.py`).

You can also explore and run other Streamlit apps that might be added to this repository in the future.



Enjoy exploring and running Streamlit web applications, and have fun creating your own! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
